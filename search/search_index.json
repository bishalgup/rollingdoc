By organizing workshops, seminars, and online content, we aim to demonstrate the value and versatility of open source tools for various geospatial applications. Foster Community Growth Our mission is to build a stronger and more engaged community of geospatial enthusiasts in Nepal. Through regular meetups, webinars, and collaborative projects, we provide a platform for networking, knowledge sharing, and skill development. Empower through Education Education continues to be a cornerstone of our efforts. We are dedicated to providing learning resources, training materials, and hands-on sessions that empower individuals with the skills needed to harness open source geospatial technologies effectively. Advocate for Open Data and Standards We persist in advocating for the use of open data and standards in Nepal's geospatial landscape. By promoting interoperability and the sharing of geospatial data, we contribute to a more accessible and transparent geospatial ecosystem.","title":"Objectives"},{"location":"Contributing/CONTRIBUTING/","text":"Contributing to OSGeoNepal Prerequisites Before you start your journey, make sure you have the following: GitHub Account: Create a GitHub account if you don't have one. You'll use this account to interact with repositories, raise issues, and submit pull requests. Git Installed: Install Git on your local machine. This is essential for cloning repositories, making changes, and pushing them back to GitHub. Familiarity with Git: Basic knowledge of Git commands is beneficial. Learn about commands like clone, branch, commit, push, and pull request. Committer Responsibilities Guidelines - Make sure to follow these OSGeo contributor guidelines . Community Standards - Make sure you have gone through our OSGeo Nepal community standards How to get started Finding the issue Find the issue: Explore the OSGeoNepal repositories, and find the issue the pique your interest. Filter by Labels: Use labels like \"beginner-friendly\" or \"good first issue\" to indicate tasks suitable for newcomers. Look for these labels when searching for issues. Read the Documentation: Go through the project's README and contributing guidelines to understand the project structure, coding conventions, and how to contribute. Register you interest: After you find the issue, register your interest to inform others/maintainers that you are interested in that particular issue. Assign: After that maintainer assigns you to the issue, or ask to assign yourself. Proper Labeling: To begin contributing, add the label Work in progress . Forking the repository Fork the repository: On the project's GitHub page, click the \"Fork\" button to create your copy of the repository. This allows you to work on changes without affecting the original project. Clone your forked repository: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the git clone command. git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository.git Make changes Create a new branch: Create a new branch in the repository that you cloned in your local machine. This is to keep your main branch clean and allows you to work on multiple features. git checkout -b <feature-name> Make Changes: Implement the changes or fixes you want to contribute. Follow the coding standards and guidelines mentioned in the project's documentation. Commit Changes: Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message. git add . git commit -m \"Add feature or fix\" Push Changes: Push your changes to your cloned GitHub repository. git push origin <feature-branch> Creating the pull request Open pull request (PR): Go to your GitHub repository, switch to your (that you pushed), and click on the \"New Pull Request\" button. Describe your changes: Write a clear and concise description of the changes you made. Reference any related issues Review process: Address the feedback that the project maintainer provide if any. Merge pull request: Once your changes are approved, the maintainers will merge your pull request into the main project. Congratulations!
